## 🚀 Key Features & Flow Model

### 1. Unified Authentication & Admin Roles
- Secure, role-based authorization using JWT and password hashing via bcrypt.
- **Three user personas**:
  - **Admin**: Has ultimate control over the flat directory database, user verification, and final lease approvals.
  - **Landlord**: Manages owned properties, views financials, tracks tenant directories, and approves rent transactions.
  - **Tenant**: Accesses personal dashboard, makes monthly rental payments via screenshot uploads, and uploads legal documents.

### 2. Admin Seeding & Landlord Claims Flow
- Admin seeds the core properties (flats) database (e.g., Block A, Block B units).
- Landlords claim existing vacant, unassigned properties.
- Property claims are routed to the Admin dashboard for approval. Once verified, the property is linked to the landlord.

### 3. Tenant Rental Flow & Dual Approval
- Tenants can browse vacant, landlord-claimed properties and click **"Rent a Property"**.
- Rental requests are routed simultaneously to the respective **Landlord** and **Admin** for approval.
- Upon dual approval, a formal `Lease` is auto-spawned, shifting the property status to `"occupied"` and initiating tenant document uploads.

### 4. Automated Document Vault & Verification
- Landlords and tenants submit key documents (ID proof, rent agreements, ownership proof, etc.).
- Admin reviews and marks documents as `"Verified by Admin"`, displaying verification badges natively across user dashboards.
